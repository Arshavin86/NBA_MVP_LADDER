  This site was created in order to utilise my own statistical model which determines who was the most valuable player (MVP) of each NBA game.The more games MVPs were won by a player during a season the more chances that player has to become MVP of that season. The same conception works in playoffs (postseason). So how is it work?
## Home page
  You can see the latest NBA news which update every hour on the home page of website. On the sidebar of that page you may click on today's date and choose the date, the games you're searching for from, in the drop down calendar. After that you'll see a list of games played that day with MVP of each game with the most impresive stats beside him. If you click on the button 'watch' under the game's box you'll get some highlights of that game. The number of games with highlights is restricted by the number of that games on the YouTube channel 'Ximo Pierto'. I have to do so in order to not go over my daily quota from Youtube API of 10,000 units per day very fast.
## Players page
  Here you can find bio of each NBA player who played at list one game for last four seasons. Use an input field on the top of the sidebar for convenient search.
